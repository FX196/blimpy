# Summary
The Blimpy--Breakthrough Listen I/O Methods for Python--package provides Python 2.7+/3.6+ utilities 
for viewing and interacting with the data formats used within the Breakthrough Listen program. 
This includes Sigproc filterbank (.fil) and HDF5 (.h5) files that contain dynamic spectra (aka 'waterfalls'), 
and guppi raw (.raw) files that contain voltage-level data. Python methods for data extraction, 
calibration, and visualization are provided. A suite of command-line utilities are also available.
